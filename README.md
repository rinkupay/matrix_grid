# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Interactive 3x3 Matrix with Click-Based Color Changes
This project is an interactive 3x3 matrix where user interactions dynamically change the colors of the boxes. The matrix consists of nine clickable boxes with the following functionalities:

Individual Box Click: Clicking on any box changes its color to green.

Tracking Click Order: The sequence of clicks is recorded.

Final Box Trigger: When the last (ninth) box is clicked, all previously clicked boxes transition to orange in the exact order they were originally clicked.

This functionality introduces an engaging visual effect while demonstrating event handling, state management, and sequential updates in a React-based UI.
